# MathResearch2019

This is a completely restructured version of [MathResearch](https://github.com/tyeknapp2/MathResearch). This version is built using Maven and will eventually get a JavaScript frontend when I decide how I want to implement that.

## The Research

This project focuses on observing Reconfiguration graphs of 2-player adversarial games such as TicTacToe and small versions of Chess. I am trying to look at smaller versions of these games to identify graph properties of their larger counter parts. I hope to be able to identify and generalize these games.


## Games
A full list of games so far:
* TicTacToe
  * Works with 3x3
* Chess
  * 2 Knights on a 3x4
  * 2 Kings on a 3x3
* L-game (To Be Implemented)
* Connect 4 (In Progress)
